# Simple Vector Store
Simple Vector Store (SVS) is a lightweight, **simple** vector store for your files. Simply point it at a directory, and it will create a vectorized version of that directory in the store of your choice, which can be easily searched semantically.

Additional documentation is coming soon, as the feature set becomes more solid.
